The accelerometer basically slows down the dc motor when an object comes near, and also the servo is rotated which could be the accelerator or the brakes which stops depending on the speed of the vehicle, this accelerometer was an idea of making a automatic acceleration and braking system
The temperature and moisture sensor basically rotates the servo based on the inputs of temeperatur and moisture. It is also controlled by a remote which after taking the inputs you can press 1 for outputs regarding the temperature and 3 for outputs regarding the moisturizer.
The third project, i tried making a beat machine kind of a drum pad, ended up being a metronome. The idea was to create repetitive beats with the buzzers which made cool sounds and with the change of pitch with the help of flex sensor.
